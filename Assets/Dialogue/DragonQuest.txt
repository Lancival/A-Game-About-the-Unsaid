1;1;Story One: A Knight in Shining Armor;2
2;1;You are a medieval noble skilled in the ways of the sword. Although you are a descendant of the prestigious house of Draach, as the youngest child of the Duke of Dragoien Lurra you stand to inherit little of value. After receiving a light but incredibly tough drake-bone shield made from the skull of ancient wyvern at the age of 16, you left your childhood home behind and became knight-errant, wandering the land in search of fame and fortune.;3
3;1;Two days ago, you arrived at the court of the King of Wysteria. Ever since you've arrived, you've sensed a strange aura of unease from the local nobility. Today, the king has summoned you to a meeting - he must be desperate to seek help from a lowly knight-errant.;4
4;1;The king explains to you that the prince and princess have been kidnapped by a dragon. And not just any dragon - it's none other than Bloodfang, the Bane of Knights! There have been rumors going around that Bloodfang has been capturing persons of royal blood from around the continent in order to start some sort of captive princess breeding program (dragons are very picky eaters). Do you agree to help rescue the king's children?;5,6
5;0;You agree.;7
6;0;You refuse.;8
7;1;You agree immediately, of course. How could possibly abandon those children to their fates? Perhaps more importantly, rescuing the children of countless noble houses would put them in your debt, forever securing your position in the political landscape and in the annals of history. You set off immediately, towards the cave where Bloodfang was last seen.;9;
8;1;As regretable as it is, Bloodfang is known as the Bane of Knights for a reason. Pursuing Bloodfang would merely be suicide. The king is disapointed, but not surprised, and you leave the next day in search of some safer adventures.;10
9;1;The next day, you arrive at the cave. Dismounting your trusty steed, you quickly decide on a plan of action;12,13,14,15
10;1;After fleeing the kingdom, you continue wandering the land, but never accomplish anything of note. Forever languishing in obscurity, you imagine what could have been if you had slain Bloodfang and rescued the children.;11
11;1;Epilogue: In modern times, your name can only be found on a musuem label - in an exhibit featuring medieval weapons and armor made from the bones of the long-extinct Draconis Nobilius. Click play to try again!;19
12;0;You charge towards the cave, shouting a challenge at the top of your lungs.;16
13;0;You sneak into the cave, hoping to catch the dragon while it slumbers.;17
14;0;You try to parlay with dragon, to reach a mutually agreeable solution.;18
15;0;You run away.;19
16;1;Bloodfang appears before you, terrible yet majestic in his crimson scales. "What a bother. I wonder when natural selection will finally produce knights who don't charge into danger without a plan?" he rumbles. Quick as a bolt of lightening, his maw flashes forward and chomps down as he swallows you whole. A moment after your death, Bloodfang coughs and disgorges a charred but otherwise undamaged shield before crawling back into his cave.;11
17;1;You manage to sneak into the cave without being detected, but you only find various bones strewn across the cavern floor. As you exit the cave, you come face to face with a crimson dragon. Shocked, you accidentally drop your shield. "Looks like meat's on the menu tonight after all," Bloodfang grins.;11
18;1;You announce your presence in front of the cave and respectfully wait for Bloodfang to emerge. When the crimson dragon finally appears, yawining, you state your intention to negotiate the release of the noble children on behalf of the King of Wysteria. Bloodfang laughs, "Ahahah! A bold move, human! That's the best joke I've heard in a long long time. It's too bad I have to kill you now." Bloodfang inhales, then blasts a wave of fire at you. Within moments, you are a black mark on the ground next to a bony shield. (Author's notes: Seriously? The dragon is the BANE OF KNIGHTS and you try to negotiate with it?);11
